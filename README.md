- Android AppsFlyer SDK **v6.10.3** 
- iOS AppsFlyer SDK **v6.10.1**

### <a id="init-sdk-deeplink"> AD_ID permission for Android

In v6.8.0 of the AppsFlyer SDK, we added the normal permission com.google.android.gms.permission.AD_ID to the SDK's AndroidManifest, to allow the SDK to collect the Android Advertising ID on apps targeting API 33. If your app is targeting children, you need to revoke this permission to comply with Google's Data policy. You can read more about it [here](https://dev.appsflyer.com/hc/docs/install-android-sdk#the-ad_id-permission).

## <a id="breaking-changes">     ‚ùó‚ùó Breaking changes when updating to 6.6.0 ‚ùó‚ùó
- Starting version 6.6.0, there is no more need to differentiate between iOS and Android APIs. All APIs must be called with `AppsFlyer` class (even if the API is only iOS or Android).
- Please take into consideration that since version 6.6.0, most of the APIs require `initSDK` to be called prior to using them, only a handful of APIs will properly work when called prior to initialization: `setIsDebug`, `setCurrencyCode`, `setHost`, `disableSKAdNetwork`.

Example:

Before 6.6.0:
```c#
#if UNITY_IOS && !UNITY_EDITOR
    AppsFlyeriOS.waitForATTUserAuthorizationWithTimeoutInterval(60);
#endif
```
---

After 6.6.0:
```c#
#if UNITY_IOS && !UNITY_EDITOR
    AppsFlyer.waitForATTUserAuthorizationWithTimeoutInterval(60);
#endif
```

## <a id="breaking-changes">     ‚ùó‚ùó Breaking changes when updating to 6.3.0 ‚ùó‚ùó

- 6.3.0 supports Universal Windows Platform. As part of this update, the AppsFlyerObjectScript changes to include the app_id for your UWP app. If you made changes to this file, please merge them with the new AppsFlyerObjectScript.
Please also note that you can leave the uwp app id field empty. 

- From version `6.3.0`, we use `xcframework` for iOS platform, then you need to use cocoapods version >= 1.10
