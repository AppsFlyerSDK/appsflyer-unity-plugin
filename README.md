## <a id="breaking-changes"> 	‚ùó‚ùó Breaking changes when updating to 6.3.0 ‚ùó‚ùó

- 6.3.0 supports Universal Windows Platform. As part of this update, the AppsFlyerObjectScript changes to include the app_id for your UWP app. If you made changes to this file, please merge them with the new AppsFlyerObjectScript.
Please also note that you can leave the uwp app id field empty. 

- From version `6.3.0`, we use `xcframework` for iOS platform, then you need to use cocoapods version >= 1.10
