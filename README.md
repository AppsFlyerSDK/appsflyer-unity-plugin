### <a id="plugin-build-for"> This plugin is built for

- Android AppsFlyer SDK **v6.6.0** 
- iOS AppsFlyer SDK **v6.6.0**

## <a id="breaking-changes"> 	‚ùó‚ùó Breaking changes when updating to 6.6.0 ‚ùó‚ùó
- Starting version 6.6.0, there is no more need to differiencate between iOS and Android API. All API must be called with `AppsFlyer` class (even if the API is only iOS or Android).

Example:

Before 6.6.0:
```c#
#if UNITY_IOS && !UNITY_EDITOR
    AppsFlyeriOS.waitForATTUserAuthorizationWithTimeoutInterval(60);
#endif
```
---

After 6.6.0:
```c#
#if UNITY_IOS && !UNITY_EDITOR
    AppsFlyer.waitForATTUserAuthorizationWithTimeoutInterval(60);
#endif
```
---

## <a id="breaking-changes"> 	‚ùó‚ùó Breaking changes when updating to 6.3.0 ‚ùó‚ùó

- 6.3.0 supports Universal Windows Platform. As part of this update, the AppsFlyerObjectScript changes to include the app_id for your UWP app. If you made changes to this file, please merge them with the new AppsFlyerObjectScript.
Please also note that you can leave the uwp app id field empty. 

- From version `6.3.0`, we use `xcframework` for iOS platform, then you need to use cocoapods version >= 1.10
