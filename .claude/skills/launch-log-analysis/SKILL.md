# Launch Log Analysis

Use this skill when inspecting logs from one or more app launches.

## Goal

Analyze each launch separately and determine whether expected AppsFlyer SDK flows occurred.

## Workflow

1. Separate logs by launch/session if multiple launches exist.
2. For each launch inspect evidence for: SDK initialization (`initSDK`), SDK start (`startSDK`), conversion callbacks, deep link callbacks, in-app events, warnings or errors.
3. Compare expected vs actual behavior for that launch.
4. Detect: missing events, duplicate events, unexpected events, inconclusive evidence.
5. Produce a launch-by-launch report.

## Output Format

For each launch return:
- Launch number
- Platform
- Expected events
- Confirmed events
- Missing events
- Duplicate or unexpected events
- Relevant log evidence
- Final result: Passed | Failed | Inconclusive

## Rules

- Treat each launch separately.
- Do not merge evidence from different launches.
- Do not guess when logs are noisy or incomplete.
- Recommend additional logging if needed.
