# SDK Version Bump

Use this skill when updating the native Android or iOS SDK version wrapped by the AppsFlyer Unity plugin.

## Goal

Perform a safe, consistent version bump across C#, Android, and iOS plugin layers, maintaining both billing library variants.

## Workflow

1. Identify which SDK is being bumped: Android SDK | iOS SDK | both
2. Locate current versions:
   - Version constant in `Assets/AppsFlyer/AppsFlyer.cs`
   - `android-unity-wrapper/build.gradle` (af-android-sdk, billing library v7/v8)
   - iOS podspec or dependency declarations
   - `CHANGELOG.md`
3. Update the native SDK version in all required places.
4. Check both billing library variants (v7 and v8) — both must be updated consistently.
5. Decide whether the Unity plugin version must also be bumped.
6. Check whether changelog must be updated.
7. Note that `deploy/` `.unitypackage` files must be regenerated on release.
8. Summarize: old version, new version, files changed, billing library impact, compatibility risk, validation steps.

## What to Check

### Android
- `android-unity-wrapper/build.gradle` — `af-android-sdk` dependency
- Billing library v7 and v8 build variants — both must be updated
- ProGuard rules if new classes are added
- `AppsFlyerAndroidWrapper.java` — version constants if any

### iOS
- iOS podspec or pod dependency declarations
- `AppsFlyeriOSWrapper.mm` — version constants if any

### Unity plugin
- `Assets/AppsFlyer/AppsFlyer.cs` — version constant
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `deploy/` `.unitypackage` files (must regenerate after bump)

## Output Format

Return:
- Summary
- SDK bumped: Android | iOS | Both
- Previous version → New version
- Billing library variants impacted: v7 | v8 | both
- Files updated
- Plugin version impact
- Changelog impact
- `.unitypackage` regeneration required: Yes | No
- Validation steps
- Compatibility risk

## Rules

- Both billing library variants must be updated together.
- Do not update only one place if multiple version declarations exist.
- `.unitypackage` files are release artifacts — flag them as needing regeneration.
- Prefer a minimal and consistent change set.
