# Adding appsflyer-unity-plugin to your project


## <a id="add-sdk-to-project"> ðŸ“² Adding the SDK to your project

In order to add the plugin to your project, you can either add the unitypackage **or**  use Unity Package Manager. 
- [Installation adding the unitypackage](#installation-with-unitypackage)
- [Installation using Unity Package Manager](#installation-using-upm)


**Note:**  The plugin is built with [The External Dependency Manager for Unity](https://github.com/googlesamples/unity-jar-resolver) (EDM4U) (formerly Play Services Resolver / Jar Resolver)
* The External Dependency Manager for Unity is distributed with the `appsflyer-unity-plugin` by default.
* This will ease the integration process, by resolving dependency conflicts between your plugin and other plugins in your project.
* Adding the `appsflyer-unity-plugin.v*.unitypackage` will automatically import all the assets required for both the AppsFlyer SDK and the External Dependency Manager for Unity.


## <a id="installation-with-unitypackage"> **Using unitypackage:**
1. Clone / download this repository.
2. [Import](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AssetPackages.html) the appsflyer-unity-plugin-*.unitypackage into your Unity project.
3. Go to Assets >> Import Package >> Custom Package.
