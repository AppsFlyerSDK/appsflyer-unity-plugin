# Adding appsflyer-unity-plugin to your project

## Adding the SDK to your project

In order to add the plugin to your project, you can either add the *unitypackage* **or** use *Unity Package Manager*. 
- [Installation adding the unitypackage](#using-unitypackage)
- [Installation using Unity Package Manager](#using-unity-package-manager)

**Note:**  The plugin is built with [The External Dependency Manager for Unity](https://github.com/googlesamples/unity-jar-resolver) (EDM4U) (formerly Play Services Resolver / Jar Resolver)
* The External Dependency Manager for Unity is distributed with the `appsflyer-unity-plugin` by default.
* This will ease the integration process, by resolving dependency conflicts between your plugin and other plugins in your project.
* Adding the `appsflyer-unity-plugin.v*.unitypackage` will automatically import all the assets required for both the AppsFlyer SDK and the External Dependency Manager for Unity.

## Using unitypackage
1. Clone / download the [plugin repository](https://github.com/AppsFlyerSDK/appsflyer-unity-plugin).
2. [Import](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AssetPackages.html) the `appsflyer-unity-plugin-*.unitypackage` or `appsflyer-unity-plugin-strict-mode.*.unitypackage` file from the `strict-mode-sdk` folder for the Strict version of the plugin, into your Unity project.
3. Go to Assets >> Import Package >> Custom Package.
4. Select the `appsflyer-unity-plugin-*.unitypackage` file or the `appsflyer-unity-plugin-strict-mode.*.unitypackage` file from the `strict-mode-sdk` folder for the Strict version of the plugin.

**Note:** If you do not wish to include [The External Dependency Manager for Unity](https://github.com/googlesamples/unity-jar-resolver), refer to the steps of this [installation](#installation-without-unity-jar-resolver).

## Using Unity Package Manager

1. Follow Google's [guide](https://developers.google.com/unity/instructions) in order to integrate UPM (Unity Package Manager).
**Note:** If you do not wish to include [The External Dependency Manager for Unity](https://github.com/googlesamples/unity-jar-resolver), refer to steps 2 & 3 [here](#installation-without-unity-jar-resolver).


4. Add appsflyer-unity-plugin in the dependency :
Add this line for the latest version of the regular mode
```
 "appsflyer-unity-plugin": "https://github.com/AppsFlyerSDK/appsflyer-unity-plugin.git#upm"
```
 Or this line for latest version of the Strict mode :
```
 "appsflyer-unity-plugin": "https://github.com/AppsFlyerSDK/appsflyer-unity-plugin.git#Strict-upm"
```
5. Download the [External Dependency Manager for Unity](https://github.com/googlesamples/unity-jar-resolver) to be able to resolve our Android / iOS dependencies.

**Note:** To choose an earlier version and not the latest, you can replace the `upm` or `Strict-upm` with the specific version, `v6.10.30` for the regular version of 6.10.30 or `Strict-v6.10.30` for the Strict version of 6.10.30.
