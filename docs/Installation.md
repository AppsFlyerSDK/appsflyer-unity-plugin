* The plugin is built with [The External Dependency Manager for Unity](https://github.com/googlesamples/unity-jar-resolver) (EDM4U) (formerly Play Services Resolver / Jar Resolver)
* The External Dependency Manager for Unity is distributed with the `appsflyer-unity-plugin` by default.
* This will ease the integration process, by resolving dependency conflicts between your plugin and other plugins in your project.
* Adding the `appsflyer-unity-plugin.v*.unitypackage` will automatically import all the assets required for both the AppsFlyer SDK and the External Dependency Manager for Unity.
