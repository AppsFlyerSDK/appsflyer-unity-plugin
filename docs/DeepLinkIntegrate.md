#### The 3 Deep Linking Types:
1. Deferred Deep Linking - Serving personalized content to new or former users, directly after the installation. 
2. Direct Deep Linking - Directly serving personalized content to existing users, which already have the mobile app installed.
3. Unified deep linking (UDL) - enables you to send new and existing users to a specific in-app activity as soon as the app is opened.

For more info please check out the [OneLink™ Deep Linking Guide](https://support.appsflyer.com/hc/en-us/articles/208874366-OneLink-Deep-Linking-Guide#Intro).

    <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />

For more on Universal Links check out the guide [here](https://support.appsflyer.com/hc/en-us/articles/208874366-OneLink-Deep-Linking-Guide#setups-universal-links).
    
Essentially, the Universal Links method links between an iOS mobile app and an associate website/domain, such as AppsFlyer’s OneLink domain (xxx.onelink.me). To do so, it is required to:

1. Configure OneLink sub-domain and link to mobile app (by hosting the ‘apple-app-site-association’ file - AppsFlyer takes care of this part in the onelink setup on your dashboard)
2. Configure the mobile app to register approved domains:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
    <dict>
        <key>com.apple.developer.associated-domains</key>
        <array>
            <string>applinks:test.onelink.me</string>
        </array>
    </dict>
</plist>
```
